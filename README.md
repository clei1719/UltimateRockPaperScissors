# UltimateRockPaperScissors
 Java App 
 
 This was a self made project to learn a bit about Java and to see if I could build a working Android App in a short amount of time.  Needless to say that I was successful in this endeavor.
 
 There are of course flaws with the app that I am aware of, but again this was just to test my ability to do something in a short amount of time and get it functional.
 
 The main meat of the programming is located at:
 UltimateRockPaperScissors/app/src/main/java/com/ultimaterockpaperscissors/GamePlayScreen.java
 
 There is of course other code to look at but the main logic for the game exists at this location.
